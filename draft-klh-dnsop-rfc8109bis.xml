<abstract>

<t>This document describes the queries that a DNS resolver should emit to initialize its
cache. The result is that the resolver gets both a current NS Resource Record Set (RRset) for the root
zone and the necessary address information for reaching the root servers.</t>

<t>This document, when published, obsoletes RFC 8109.</t>

<!--

- Add more about prefetching before expiration (it is as important here as anywhere)

- Describe some common post-priming strategies for which RSI to use: always use the fastest vs. create buckets of fastness

- Talk about the format of configuration information (only need IP addresses, but typically also includes host names because it is in master file format)

- State explicitly that if the Additional section is truncated, there is no expectation that the TC bit in the response will be turned on

- Go throught he document and look how well it applies to a 'generic' root system.

<section title='Introduction'>

<t>Recursive DNS resolvers need a starting point to resolve queries. <xref
target='RFC1034'/> describes a common scenario for recursive resolvers: they
begin with an empty cache and some configuration for finding the names and
addresses of the DNS root servers. <xref target='RFC1034'/> describes that
configuration as a list of servers that will give authoritative answers to queries
about the root. This has become a common implementation choice for recursive
resolvers, and is the topic of this document. </t>

<t>This document describes the steps needed for this common implementation
choice. Note that this is not the only way to start a recursive name server with
an empty cache, but it is the only one described in <xref target='RFC1034'/>.
Some implementers have chosen other directions, some of which work well and
others of which fail (sometimes disastrously) under different conditions.
For example, an implementation that only gets the addresses of the root name
servers from configuration, not from the DNS as described in this document,
will have stale data that could cause slower resolution.</t>

<t>This document only deals with recursive name servers (recursive resolvers,
resolvers) for the IN class.</t>

<section title='Changes from RFC 8109'>

<section title='Terminology'>

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”,
and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<t>
See <xref target="RSSAC026v2"/> for terminology that relates to the root server system.

<section title="Description of Priming">

<t>Priming is the act of finding the list of root
servers from a configuration that lists some or all of the purported IP
addresses of some or all of those root servers. A recursive resolver starts with
no information about the root servers, and ends up with a list of their names
and their addresses.</t>

<t>Priming is described in Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 of <xref target='RFC1034'/>.
The scenario used in that description, that of a recursive server that is also
authoritative, is no longer as common.</t>

<t>The configured list of IP addresses for the root servers usually comes from the
vendor or distributor of the recursive server software. This list is usually
correct and complete when shipped, but may become out of date over time.</t>

<t>The domain names for the root servers are called the
"root server identifiers".
This list has been stable since 1997, but the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
for the root server identifiers sometimes change,
Research shows that after those addresses change, some resolvers never
get the new addresses.
Therefore, it is important that resolvers be able to cope with change,
even without relying upon configuration updates to be applied by their operator.
Root server identifier and address changes are the main reasons that resolvers need to do priming instead
of just going from a configured list to get a full and accurate list of root servers.
</t>

<t>
See <xref target="RSSAC023"/>for a history of the root server system.
</t>

<t>Although this document is targeted at the global DNS, it also could apply to a private
DNS as well. These terms are defined in <xref target="RFC8499"/>.</t>


<section title="Content of Priming Information">

<t>As described above, the configuration for priming is a list of IP addresses.
The priming information in software may be in any format that gives he software the
addresses associated with at least some of the root server identifiers.</t>

<t>Some software has configuration that also contains the root server identifiers,
sometimes as comments and sometimes as data consumed by the software.
In fact, IANA's "Root Hints File" at &lt;https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root&gt;
is in DNS master file format, including the root server identifiers.
Although there is no harm to adding such information, it is not useful in
the root priming process.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title='Priming Queries'>

<t>\[\[
Even with the disclaimer in the Introduction, the following paragraphs should probably
say ", and has a QCLASS of IN".
\]\]</t>

<t>A priming query is a DNS query used to get the root server information in a resolver.
It has a QNAME of "." and a QTYPE of NS, and
is sent to one of the addresses in the configuration for the recursive resolver.
The priming query can be sent over either UDP or TCP. If the query is sent over UDP,
the source port SHOULD be randomly selected (see <xref target='RFC5452'/>). The
Recursion Desired (RD) bit MAY be set to 0 or 1, although the meaning of it being set to 1 is
undefined for priming queries.</t>

<t>The recursive resolver SHOULD use EDNS0 <xref target='RFC6891'/> for priming
queries and SHOULD announce and handle a reassembly size of at least 1024 octets
<xref target='RFC3226'/>. Doing so allows responses that cover the size of a
full priming response (see <xref target='primrespsize'/>) for the current
set of root servers.
See <xref target="dnssec_prime"/> for discussion of setting the
DNSSEC OK (DO) bit (defined in <xref target='RFC4033'/>).</t>

<section title='Repeating Priming Queries'>

<t>The recursive resolver SHOULD send a priming query only when it is needed,
such as when the resolver starts with an empty cache and when the NS RRset for
the root zone has expired.
Because the NS records for the root are not special, the recursive resolver
expires those NS records according to their TTL values.
(Note that a recursive resolver MAY
pre-fetch the NS RRset before it expires.)</t>

<t>If a priming query does not get a response, the recursive
resolver needs to retry the query with a different target address from the
configuration.</t>

</section>

<section title='Target Selection'>

<t>In order to spread the load across all the root server identifers, the
recursive resolver SHOULD select the target for a priming query randomly from
the list of addresses. The recursive resolver might choose either IPv4 or IPv6
addresses based on its knowledge of whether the system on which it is running
has adequate connectivity on either type of address.</t>

<t>Note that this recommended method is not the only way to choose from the list
in a recursive resolver's configuration. Two other common methods include
picking the first from the list, and remembering which address in the list gave
the fastest response earlier and using that one. There are probably other
methods in use today. However, the random method listed above
SHOULD be used for priming.</t>

</section>

<section title='DNSSEC with Priming Queries' anchor="dnssec_prime">

<t>\[\[
This section talks about sending the DO bit, but does not actually talk about
validating the response to the priming query. This became important after
the root KSK rollover in 2018 because some resolvers apparently were validating
and only had the old KSK, but were still sending RFC 8145 telemetry even after failing
to validate their priming response.
\]\]</t>

<t>The resolver MAY set the DNSSEC OK (DO) bit. At the time of publication,
there is little use to performing DNSSEC validation on the priming query.
Currently, all root name server names end in "root-servers.net" and the AAAA and A RRsets
for the root server names reside in the "root-servers.net" zone. All root servers are also
authoritative for this zone, allowing priming responses to include the appropriate root
name server A and AAAA RRsets. But, because the "root-servers.net" zone is not currently
signed, these RRsets cannot be validated.</t>

<t>A man-in-the-middle attack on the priming query could direct a resolver to a rogue root
name server.  Note, however, that a validating resolver will not accept responses from
rogue root name servers if they are different from the real responses because the resolver
has a trust anchor for the root and the answers from the root are signed. Thus, if there
is a man-in-the-middle attack on the priming query, the only result for a validating
resolver will be a denial of service, not the resolver's accepting the bad responses.</t>

<t>If the "root-servers.net" zone is later signed, or if the root servers are named in a
different zone and that zone is signed, having DNSSEC validation for the priming queries
might be valuable.</t>


</section>

</section>

<section title='Priming Responses'>

<t>A priming query is a normal DNS query. Thus, a root name server cannot
distinguish a priming query from any other query for the root NS RRset. Thus,
the root server's response will also be a normal DNS response.</t>

<section title='Expected Properties of the Priming Response'>

<t>The priming response is expected to have an RCODE of NOERROR, and to have the
Authoritative Answer (AA) bit set. Also, it is expected to have an NS RRset in the Answer section (because the
NS RRset originates from the root zone), and an empty Authority section (because the
NS RRset already appears in the Answer section). There will also be an Additional section with A
and/or AAAA RRsets for the root name servers pointed at by the NS RRset.</t>

<t>Resolver software SHOULD treat the response to the priming query as a normal
DNS response, just as it would use any other data fed to its cache. Resolver
software SHOULD NOT expect exactly 13 NS RRs
because, historically, some root servers have returned fewer.</t>

</section>

<section title='Completeness of the Response' anchor='primrespsize'>

<t>There are currently 13 root servers. All have one IPv4 address and one IPv6 address.
Not even counting the NS RRset, the combined size of all the A and AAAA RRsets
exceeds the original 512-octet payload limit from <xref target="RFC1035"/>.</t>

<t>In the event of a response where the Additional section omits certain root server
address information, re-issuing of the priming query does not help with those root name
servers that respond with a fixed order of addresses in the Additional section.  Instead,
the recursive resolver needs to issue direct queries for A and AAAA RRsets for the
remaining names. Currently, these RRsets would be authoritatively available from the root
name servers.</t>

<t>If the Additional section is truncated, there is no expectation that the TC bit in the
response will be set to 1. At the time that this document is written, many of the
root servers are not setting the TC bit on responses with a truncated Additional section.</t>



</section>

</section>

<section title='Security Considerations'>

<t>Spoofing a response to a priming query can be used to redirect all
of the queries originating from a victim recursive resolver to one
or more servers for the attacker. Until the responses to priming queries
are protected with DNSSEC, there is no definitive way to prevent such
redirection.</t>

<t>An on-path attacker who sees a priming query coming from a resolver can inject false
answers before a root server can give correct answers. If the attacker's answers are
accepted, this can set up the ability to give further false answers for future queries to
the resolver. False answers for root servers are more dangerous than, say, false answers
for Top-Level Domains (TLDs), because the root is the highest node of the DNS. See
<xref target="dnssec_prime"/> for more discussion.</t>

<t>In both of the scenarios above, a validating resolver will be able to detect the attack
if its chain of queries comes to a zone that is signed, but not for those that are unsigned.</t>
